# TDD On The Rocks

### This TDD excercise was proposed by Hernan Wilkinson

The idea of the excercise was to introduce TDD to the audience.

The language I chose to resolve the excercise was Ruby
(it was up to the participant to choose the language).

The Kata chosen for the exercise was to create a Calendar for Not Working Days
